    <h2 class="story_heading">OUR STORY</h2>
    <p class="letter_heading">LETTER FROM THE FOUNDER:<p>
    <div class="founder">
    <p class="founder_space"> Early 2017 I was interviewing candidates for a summer programming internship.  I was impressed by the eagerness and passion of the applicants who were hungry for the opportunity to learn and to work for a tech company. Most of the applicants had attended coding bootcamps, which put students through a 12-week immersive course with the promise of being ready for an entry level programming job at graduation. However, during the interview process it was painful to see these students fail to answer even the most basic questions regarding computer programming</p>
    <p class="founder_space">As a result, I decided to start a small organization to teach people the fundamentals of how to program a computer. I don't believe you have to get a formal education to gain the skills necessary to be a professional computer programmer.  Personally, I have never had the opportunity to attend college; I am completely self-taught.</p>
    <p class="founder_space">I founded DevNano to share the methodology I used to teach myself computer programming. I can tell you it didn't happen by cramming for 12 weeks and then applying for an entry level job.  It came from building a solid foundation of fundamental principles and learning how to be a builder.</p>
    <p class="founder_space">I believe that everyone should learn how to program a computer. Learning to program teaches individuals how to think, how to be creative, how to be innovative and how to better solve problems. Learning to program also helps individuals better understand the technology shaping our modern world. I understand not everyone is going to be a professional, but that shouldn't restrict them from learning the basics.</p>
    <p class="founder_space">At a higher level, DevNano is not just here to help people learn how to code, but to teach them how to be builders. There is an intrinsic satisfaction that comes from building your first website.  The satisfaction continues as your learn how to build web applications, mobile applications, distributed systems, and more.</p>
    <p class="founder_space">Lastly, the computer programming profession has treated me well. I feel it my obligation to pay it forward. I want to share the joy that comes from programming, from building, and from solving problems. At DevNano, all net proceeds from our starter courses are donated to charity.  There are many people in this world that aren't as fortunate or healthy as we are, and our organization aims to help them.  I hope you will join us for one of our courses and start this amazing journey.</p>
